### To build the ISOFIT images, you run each script from the repo root. e.g.

Within the main folder, run

```
bash scripts/build_isofit_multiarch.sh
```

This will build the AMD64/AMR64 version for running locally on a host computer

<br>

To build the version to run on the NASA Airborne SMCE hub environment, use: 

```
bash scripts/build_isofit_smce_hub.sh
```
